## 💰 Understanding Your Budget

### What's a Budget?

A budget is the **total amount of money** you can spend for the week.

Think of it like this:
> You have a jar with $30 in it. Every time you pick lunch, some money comes out. When the jar is empty, you're done!

### The Budget Bar

Look at the top of the app. You'll see a colored bar:

| Color | What It Means |
|-------|---------------|
| 🟢 **Green** | You're doing great! Lots of money left |
| 🟡 **Yellow** | Heads up! You're using a lot |
| 🔴 **Red** | Uh oh! You went over budget |

### Your Weekly Budget: $30

That's about **$6 per day** for 5 school days.

Here's what $6 looks like:
- ✅ Pizza ($6.95) + Water ($0.75) = $7.70 — a little over
- ✅ Soup ($3.95) + Side ($3.00) + Water ($0.75) = $7.70 — a little over  
- ✅ Smashburger ($6.95) + Water ($0.75) = $7.70 — a little over
- ❌ Jerk Chicken ($9.00) + Gatorade ($3.50) = $12.50 — way over!

**The trick:** Some days go a little over, some days go under. It balances out!

## 🧠 Smart Money Moves

### Save Money Here:
| Instead Of... | Try... | You Save |
|---------------|--------|----------|
| Gatorade ($3.50) | Water ($0.75) | $2.75! |
| Body Armor ($4.50) | Milk ($1.65) | $2.85! |
| Two sides ($6.00) | One side ($3.00) | $3.00! |

### Splurge Days vs. Save Days

**Splurge Day Example (Monday):**
- Jerk Chicken: $9.00
- Rice & Peas: $3.00
- Gatorade: $3.50
- **Total: $15.50** 😱

**Save Day Example (Tuesday):**
- Cheese Pizza: $6.95
- Water: $0.75
- **Total: $7.70** 😎

**Combined: $23.20** — Still under $30! ✅

See? You can have a big day if you balance it with a smaller day.

## 🎯 Your Job

Here's what Dad is counting on you to do:

### ✅ DO:
- Pick your own lunches (you know what you like!)
- Watch the budget bar
- Try to stay in the green
- Send the order to Dad before Sunday night
- Be honest about what you'll actually eat

### ❌ DON'T:
- Go way over budget without asking
- Pick stuff just because it's expensive
- Forget to send the order
- Pick food you won't eat (that's wasting money!)

## 🤔 What If I Go Over Budget?

**It's okay!** Here's what to do:

1. **A little over ($1-3)?** That's fine, just balance it next week
2. **A lot over ($5+)?** Remove something or swap for cheaper
3. **Way over ($10+)?** Talk to Dad before sending

The app will warn you with a red bar and a message. Don't panic! Just adjust your picks.

Learning to manage a food budget now means:

- 🎓 You'll be great with money when you're older

- 🤝 Dad trusts you with real responsibility

## ❓ Questions?

**"What if the menu is wrong?"**
Tell Dad. The school sometimes changes things.

**"What if I forget to order?"**
You might have to buy lunch that day with cash, or pack from home.

**"What if I don't like anything?"**
Pizza and salad are always available. Or talk to Dad about packing lunch that day.

**"Can I save money for something else?"**
Ask Dad! Maybe leftover budget could go toward something fun.
